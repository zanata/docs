	<title>Java variable validations in translation editor</title>
	<!-- The title is inherited from the title property of the topic -->
	<para>
		Zanata did not detect inconsistencies in Java-style variables between source strings and translated strings. As a consequence, translators could modify Java variables embedded in strings, causing compilation or runtime errors in localised builds of Java software projects. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Zanata 1.6 adds a validator to the web editor to check for Java variables in the source and translated strings. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Java style variables use an index number and may have a format specifier. The validator checks that: 
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				all index numbers that are present in source are present in target 
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				all index numbers that are present in target are present in source 
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				each index number is present the same number of times in the source and target 
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
		A validation error is displayed near the string currently being edited if any of the above conditions are not met. 
	</para>
	<para>
		The validator does not yet perform any validation of format specifiers.
