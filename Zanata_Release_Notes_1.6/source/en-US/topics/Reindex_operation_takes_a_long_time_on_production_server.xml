	<title>Reindex operation takes a long time on production server</title>
	<!-- The title is inherited from the title property of the topic -->
	<para>
		Zanata has a number of indexes that are used to locate information on the server. These indexes are periodically updated. The search re-indexing operation always discarded all existing indexes. This caused re-indexing to take a long time, even when only a single class was being reindexed. While the re-indexing operation was taking place, searches did not return good results. 
	</para>
	<para>
		The Search re-index backing beans now take a set of boolean options for each indexable class. These options determine whether existing indexes for the class will be purged, whether re-index will be performed on entities of the class, and whether the index for the class will be optimized. These options are presented in a table on the "Manage Search" page under the Administration menu. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Classes can now be re-indexed separately, allowing for shorter re-index time per operation. Existing indexes can be kept during re-indexing, so searches may be able to return good results during re-index.
