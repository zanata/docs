	<title>Translation memory shortcut keys don't work</title>
	<!-- The title is inherited from the title property of the topic -->
	<para>
		The code for the translation memory copy shortcut keys Ctrl+Shift+[1-4] checked for characters rather than key codes. The numbers on a keyboard number pad were not recognised, and on some keyboard mappings numbers above 2 were not recognised. 
	</para>
	<para>
		The code was rewritten to recognise keyboard codes, rather than characters. Pressing Ctrl+Shift+[1-4] now copies the translation memory match.
