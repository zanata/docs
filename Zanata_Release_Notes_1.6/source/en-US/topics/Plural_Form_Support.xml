		In translation files, msg_plural entries provide multiple versions of a noun string. These entries allows software to present the correct singular or plural version of the noun to match a number in a message. Zanata did not support plural forms, and silently ignored msg_plural entries in POT/PO files.

	<para>
		Zanata now supports msg_plural entries. Plurals are now accepted/returned via REST clients, accepted/displayed in the editor UI and in TM search results.
