		Zanata is a web-based translation management system. Zanata provides an interface that allows a community of translators to work side-by-side on translation projects with nothing more than an Internet connection and a web-browser. Zanata provides APIs and client-side tools that allow software developers and documentation authors to push content to the server for translation and pull completed translations back for their project.
