		Zanata provided notifications and error messages in the page header of the editor. The page header took up screen space, which was not available for translation units. Additionally, notifications and error messages would be overwritten by later messages. This message overwriting made it difficult to read a message if it was immediately followed by another.

		In Zanata 1.6 the page header uses a single line, leaving more space for translation. Error messages now appear in pop-ups.
