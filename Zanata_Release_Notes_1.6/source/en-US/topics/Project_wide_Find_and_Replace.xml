	<title>Project-wide Search and Replace</title>
	<para>
		Translation projects contain a number of distinct files with source material. Applying the same change across a number of files requires opening each file, finding the item that needs to be changed, and applying the change. Zanata's Find and Replace function worked within a file, but not across files.

		Zanata now has a "Find and Replace" feature that works across all the files in a project. Users can now apply a change across all the files in the project from a single point in the user interface. Please see the bug report for more details on the state of this feature in the alpha release.
