	<title>Project-wide Search and Replace: Undo button</title>
	<!-- The title is inherited from the title property of the topic -->
	<para>
		Zanata includes a facility for performing search and replace operations, on both single entries and multiple entries. Replace operations could not be programmatically reversed. Users had to manually revert a change, or several changes if multiple search results were replaced at once. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Zanata 1.6 now includes an <firstterm>undo</firstterm> for Search and Replace.

				An 'undo' link is presented next to the message (bottom right) when multiple translations are replaced.

				Individual 'Undo' buttons can be used after 'Replace All Selected' if the user wants to undo only some of a set of replaced translations.

			<para>
				Undo is only available until the translation is updated, so the 'Undo' button for a text flow will change back to 'Replace' if another user saves a translation (this is to prevent new translations being overwritten with an older translation).
