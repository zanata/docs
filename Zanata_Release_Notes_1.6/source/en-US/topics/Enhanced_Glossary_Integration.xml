	<title>Enhanced Glossary Integration</title>
	<para>
		A Translation Glossary provides standard translations for technical terms. Zanata supports Translation Glossaries. Users requested to be alerted to any applicable Glossary terms when working on a translation unit, and to be able to copy a translation from the Glossary into the current translation unit. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Users were not alerted when relevant Glossary terms existed, and had to manually copy and paste Glossary terms in the translation editor. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Automatic alerting and copy from Glossary have been implemented. When one or more relevant Glossary terms exist, the color of the Glossary tab changes from blue to red. A "Copy" button next to each Glossary term enables the translator to copy Glossary translations to the current translation unit.
