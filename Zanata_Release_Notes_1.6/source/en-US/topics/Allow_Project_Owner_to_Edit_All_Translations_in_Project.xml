	<title>Allow Project Owner to Edit All Translations in Project</title>
	<!-- The title is inherited from the title property of the topic -->
	<para>
		In order to edit the translations for a language, a user must be a member of that language group in Zanata. Project owners were unable to edit the translations in their own project, unless they became a member of all language groups for which they had translations. This made applying an update to all translations in a project difficult. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Project owners can now edit all language translations in their project without joining multiple language groups.
